In addition to that, I have witnessed/experienced multiple unethical behaviors/comments from multiple Professors.  One lab, the PI was proselytizing to all the lab members about religion (one of the lab members was openly playing a religious sermon in the lab, too).

When emailing professors for a first meeting (as in scheduling rotations or short meetings for advice on experiments within their specialties), guess which one garners responses? 
The effect is somewhat mitigated after a first conversation when there is at least a memory of me, but I am aware that my colleagues have had many more faculty invested in their success than I have had. Whether this is simply a mismatch of cultural norms or active discrimination is not the point - there are simply more opportunities for help if one looks or speaks a certain way. 
For more specificity, here are some examples.
Example 1: There was an instance where my PI and I accompanied a safety inspector's review of student signatures on documents. Upon noticing that I shared a last name with a lab member, she remarked ""Oh! Are you two related? You have the same last name!"" My PI, seeing me visibly perturbed, responds with a come-on-let-it-go face, ""Well, it's not a common name."" My surname is in fact a very common name. This would have been a prime opportunity for him to cure her of the ignorance by saying ""Well it's a common name in X culture"", because he had two students of the same ethnicity with the same name, but obviously not related. The question then becomes, ""well why didn't you say anything?"" to which I would respond that I simply should not have to in a mentor-mentee relationship. 
Example 2: 
My PI is for some reason very annoyed at not knowing that it is one of his student's birthdays and finds out on the day of. After one such occurrence, he proceeded to jokingly ask the only female student in the lab, ""You're supposed to keep track of these things."" 
Example 3: 
Just prior to the pandemic, a Chinese international student in the lab began wearing a mask. In a private meeting with me, my PI expressed hesitation in asking whether he had contracted COVID, because he ""sees a lot of them wearing masks anyway.""

",No,,"How could I have reported these events and not expected repercussions only towards myself? The power dynamic is so incredibly vast. The responsibility cannot be on the graduate student in the current system. Our very basic capability to live and eat is based on our PI's opinion of what we can provide to them. Persistent aversion to conflict on the part of faculty members completely destroys opportunities for open discussion and there is no incentive for that to change. For faculty, there are simply no meaningful repercussions, even in cases with egregious offense. 
Also, to whom would one even report? It took a very high-visibility national movement to spawn a BMCDB exploratory committee, emphasis on exploratory. From early Zoom meetings, it feels as if the onus is put back on the graduate students. The conversation boils down to ""We can't institute change because the rules say no, but you students go ahead and push for change because this is really your problem.""
